
STRATEGY:

1.Use the AWS  organization console to group the 10 freelancers together
 
   and create an organization by consolidating their AWS account together

2. utilize the  AWS organization of IAM principals (users and roles).

3.Assign the Identity-based policies to the ten group of people by Enabling all features in your organization

4.By default, it attaches an AWS managed policy called FullAWSAccess to all roots, OUs, and accounts.

   They can access any service or operation.
 
5. restrict permissions,Blacklist all these 10 freelancers and 
 
   add the policy that they are restricted to use the AWS account when they are not connected to organization netwrok.

6.use the advanced account management features available in AWS Organizations such as service control policies (SCPs). 
   
   and use blacklisting techniques  to filter the permissions that are available to accounts. 

7.Users and roles in the affected accounts can then exercise only that level of access,
 
   even if their IAM policies allow all actions

Example IAM policy:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Allowaccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
				"AWS":[
						"arn:aws:iam::094697565664:user/Casey",
                        "arn:aws:iam::094697565664:user/David",
                        "arn:aws:iam::094697565664:user/Tom",
                        "arn:aws:iam::094697565664:user/Michael",
                        "arn:aws:iam::094697565664:user/Brenda",

                        "arn:aws:iam::087695765465:user/Michelle"
]
},
            "Action": "access",
            "Resource": "individual AWS account/*",
            "Condition": { when the members are connected to organization network only
                         }
        }
    ]
}
