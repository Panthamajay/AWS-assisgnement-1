steps:

1.created an EC2 in a VPC in region (ohio)

2.created an EFS in the same VPC that is used for creating Amazon EC2 instance

3. mount targets are created in all the available regions so that we can mount file system on Amazon EC2 instances created in any of the Amazon VPC subnets.

4.noted the File system ID value.

5.noted down the file system's DNS name.

6.launched the ec2 intance using mobaxterm.

7.On  EC2 instance, installed the Apache web server and configured it using

      $ sudo yum -y install httpd (Apache HTTPD is an HTTP server daemon )

8.Started the service using $ sudo service httpd start  

9.created the subdirectory under DOCUMENT ROOT $ sudo mkdir /var/www/html/efs

10.Mounted the Amazon EFS file system with mount command using the EFS mount helper utility by providing your file system ID.

     $ sudo mount -t efs fs-1d1b4d64:/ /var/www/html/efs  

11.Added a rule in the EC2 instance security group to allow HTTP traffic on TCP port 80 from anywhere 

12.changed directory to /var/www/html/efs

13.created a subdirectory sudo mkdir subdirectory

14.changed the ownership to ec2-user  sudo chown  ec2-user subdirectory

15.changed the directory to subdirectory

16.created a index.html file  echo "<html><h1>Hey , this is from Amazon EFS</h1></html>" > index.html

17.accessed the file by entering the public DNS name of ec2 instance followed by filename in web browser

        http://ec2-18-191-189-226.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/efs/subdirectory/index.html

18.created a snapshot of the ec2 instance 

19.selectedthe snapshot and deployed it in another region (n.virginia)
